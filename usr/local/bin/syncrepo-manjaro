# NOTE: This script updates the Manjaro Repo

# This is a simple mirroring script. Unlike Arch, Manjaro does ot provide timestamps.
# Therefore, the entire Repo has to be rsynced every few hours (according to Manjaro Wiki)
# Run this script via cron or systemd/Timers to keep the Repo updated.

# Directory where the repo is stored locally. Example: /srv/mirrors/manjaro
target="/srv/mirrors/manjaro"

# Directory where files are downloaded to before being moved in place.
# This should be on the same filesystem as $target, but not a subdirectory of $target.
# Example: /srv/tmp/syncrepo-manaro-tmp
tmp="/srv/tmp/syncrepo-manjaro-tmp"

# Lockfile path
lock="/var/lock/syncrepo-manjaro.lck"

# If you want to limit the bandwidth used by rsync set this.
# Use 0 to disable the limit.
# The default unit is KiB (see man rsync /--bwlimit for more)
bwlimit=1000

# The source URL of the mirror you want to sync from.
# Please refer to Manjaro wiki for other options
source_url='rsync://mirror.yandex.ru/mirrors/manjaro/'
